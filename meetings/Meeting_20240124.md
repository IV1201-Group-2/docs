# IV1201 Meeting 3

## Email Inquiry
- Send an email to inquire about cloud service recommendations for the microservices project.

## Architectural Decisions
- Code snippets specific to a language that require a certain library do not necessitate a group decision. However, all architectural decisions must be documented, both for the individual microservice and for the overall project.
- Individual decisions made by a person for their microservice should be documented with their name, e.g., "Hannes decided."
- Decisions affecting the entire team should use "we decided."
- All decisions should include a log of the time when the decision was made and who made it.
- Within a microservice, the owner decides on its architectural design, provided it includes a communication and service layer. The endpoints must present a consistent design externally.
