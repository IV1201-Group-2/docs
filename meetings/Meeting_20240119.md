# Meeting Notes - 2024-01-19

## Agenda

- Maintain a log of all architectural decisions
- Preparation of document or utilization of GitHub wiki for documentation
- Appointment of a secretary
- Daniel is responsible for documenting common decisions
- Each individual is responsible for documenting their own decisions

### Communication
- Public GitHub Wiki
- Private Discord

### Scrum Artefacts
- Sprint planning on the first Monday of the week (physical/digital as needed)
- Standup meetings on Wednesday of the first week, Monday and Wednesday of the second week (digital)
- Demo before retrospective on the second Friday (physical)
- Retrospective on the second Friday (physical)
- Iteration ends on the second Friday
- Flexible scheduling, no fixed weekdays
- Both physical and online meetings
- Use of GitHub project boards

### Code Conventions
- Java:
  - PascalCase for classes
  - camelCase for variables and functions
  - Initialization of class members through the constructor
  - Use `throws` only if the exception is handled in an outer method
  - Avoid `static` keyword unless reducing duplicate code or for singleton pattern
  - No empty catch blocks; use `e.printStackTrace()` if unsure
  - Class members should be `private final` and accessed through getters; `private` is also acceptable if necessary

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript:
  - PascalCase for JavaScript classes
  - camelCase for variables and functions
  - kebab-case for HTML pages and CSS classes/ids

- SQL:
  - Tables named in plural (e.g., 'users' instead of 'user')
  - snake_case for tables and columns
  - UPPERCASE for SQL keywords
  - Use normal quotation marks for queries that fit on one line and triple quotation marks (Java text blocks) for longer queries

- Go:
  - Run `gofmt` for formatting

### Frameworks
- Frontend: React, Bootstrap, Jest
- Backend: Spring Boot (Java), Echo (Go), Flask (Python)
- Testcontainers for testing

### Architectural Considerations
- Appropriately layered architecture with MVVM on the client-side
- Discussion on microservices and whether to use MVC or MVVM
- Consideration of design patterns like DTO
- Documentation using tools like JavaDoc for Java/Spring, GoDoc, and DocStrings in Python (Google format)

### Integration and Build Tools
- Frequent commits and pushes
- Branch naming conventions: kebab-case, named after feature
- Creation of branches and pull requests reviewed by others before merging
- Early setup of CI/CD pipeline
- Use of build tools like Maven, virtual environments for Python, and Go modules

### Deployment and Documentation
- Application live on a cloud platform (provisionally Heroku)
- Source code available in a public Git repository
- Documentation for handover
- GUI implementation for all server-side functionality
- Ensuring web pages work well in major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) confirmed during demos

### Additional Points
- Data migration from legacy databases
- Handling of missing data for bonus points
- Group report discussions and links to resources



## Questions

### Ask Leif
- MVC vs MVVM
- How to split up database in microservices
- User interface relevance?
- Clarification on statement: "There must be a GUI for all server-side functionality"
- Inquiry on the necessity to submit the report before the deadline for higher grade points
- Explanation required for: "The result shall be a complete architecture implemented in code. It is not intended that the product shall be ready for use; instead, you shall develop a code skeleton spanning all layers."
- Question regarding internationalization concerning the database
- Concerns about plagiarism when using code from previous projects for password encryption

### Research
- Explore Kubernetes event-driven architecture
- Debate on using monorepo vs multiple repos for microservices
- Investigate cloud services
- Delve into internationalization
