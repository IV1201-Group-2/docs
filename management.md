# Project Management

## Agile project management

* **Decision:** Scrum
	* **Time:** Meeting 1 (2024-01-19)
	* **Reasoning:** We decided to follow a Scrum-like model for our project. We're all used to Scrum and it's widely used within the industry. We decided sprint planning, standups and retrospectives were necessary for everyone to have a clear idea of what they need to work on.
	* **Who decided:** The group

* **Decision:** Core hours
	* **Time:** Meeting 4 (2024-01-29)
	* **Reasoning:** Everyone in the group should be reachable between 13-17 on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. Everyone is expected to respond to messages (not necessarily solve an issue) within an hour.

## Issue tracking

* **Decision:** GitHub Projects
	* **Time:** Meeting 1 (2024-01-19)
	* **Reasoning:** We decided to keep everything on GitHub because all data is organized on the same platform and integrates well with repositories and issue tracking.
	* **Who decided:** The group

* **Decision:** GitHub Issues
	* **Time:** Meeting 4 (2024-01-29)
	* **Reasoning:** We decided to use GitHub issues for our task breakdowns. This allows us to incrementally track and complete a task by closing issues once a pull request has been merged.
	* **Who decided:** Hannes
