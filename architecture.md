# Project Architecture

## Services

The team decided to adopt a microservice architecture. This gives more flexibility in the languages and frameworks that the team can use. Each team member can use the development environment that they're most comfortable with.

The team members decided to use the following languages and frameworks:

* **Daniel and Yas:** Java with Spring Boot
* **Azmeer:** Python with Flask
* **Hannes:** Go with Echo

## Cloud hosting

## Rendering

## Database

## Version control

The team decided on multiple repos instead of a single monorepo. This fits better with the microservice design. Different team members will be working on isolated services at the same time.

## CI/CD

## Testing
